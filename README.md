# THE MODPACK IS DICONTINUED!

I continue the work under a new modpack named [Nekomata Edition](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Netruitus/Nekomata_Edition/). All future updates will be provided for the new modpack. Most of the functionality will stay the same, just the updates and support will be extended.

Updating individual mods independently may lead to further instability.

## Disclaimer

I'm well aware that the IntroTweaks mod is deprecated, but it will be left as a part of the modpack until an alternative will be created.
